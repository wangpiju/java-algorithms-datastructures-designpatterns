## 🚀 Getting Started

No extra setup required!  
Just clone the repository and open it in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).

**To run a specific example:**

1. Navigate to the desired class with a `main` method (e.g., `algorithms/InsertionSort.java`).
2. Run the file directly.

## 🧩 Example Usage

```java
// Example: Running InsertionSort
public static void main(String[] args) {
    char[] data = {'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'E'};
    InsertionSort.insertionSort(data);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(data)); // Output: [A, B, C, D, E]
}
```
